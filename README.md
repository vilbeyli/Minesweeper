# Minesweeper

A 3D Minesweeper clone, made in Unity3D 4.6 (upgraded to Unity3D 5). The game has a global
leaderboard and an options menu. I spent some time toying with UI elements and some effects.

Taking the classic and simple structured mines game, and reimagining it to become quite the challenge for even the toughest gamers in the world, I present to you, the classic version of the minesweepers game!

The high point of this exciting game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines or landmines in the least time, and without having them go off, with help from clues about the number of neighboring landmine in each field.

In this version, your play experience is taken some notches higher, as you can now try to match and beat global high scores of excellent players!
